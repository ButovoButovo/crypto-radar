# Data Fetching Module

This module is used to retrieve market data from an exchange via an API.

## Market Data Source

We utilize [ccxt](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt), a universal library for interacting with various cryptocurrency exchanges.

Currently, the data is fetched from **Bybit**, but the library supports over 100 exchanges, allowing you to switch to another one easily by modifying the configuration.

### Data We Retrieve:

1. **OHLCV (Candlestick Data)**  
   - `Timestamp`: Time of the candle opening.  
   - `Open`: Opening price.  
   - `High`: Highest price.  
   - `Low`: Lowest price.  
   - `Close`: Closing price.  
   - `Volume`: Trading volume.  

   **Note:** We fetch the **latest 200 hourly candles** by default. This includes open, high, low, close, and volume data for the last 200 hours.

2. **Available Trading Pairs (Symbols)**  
   - We filter pairs ending with `/USDT`.

3. **Parameters and Settings:**  
   - Timeframes: `1m`, `5m`, `1h`, `1d`, etc.  
   - Maximum number of candles: 200 (Bybit API limit).

### API Keys

Accessing data requires registering on Bybit and obtaining API keys. Ensure they are properly configured in the application.

### Configuration Example:

Make sure the following is set up in your `exchange` file:

```javascript
const ccxt = require('ccxt');
const exchange = new ccxt.bybit({
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    secret: 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
});
module.exports = exchange;
```

# Indicators Calculated in the Code

## 1.1 ATR (Average True Range)
**Purpose:** ATR measures market volatility, showing how much the price of an asset changes over a given period.  
**How it's calculated:**  
The `technicalIndicators.ATR.calculate` method is used in the code to calculate ATR based on data for the high, low, and close prices.  
The `period` parameter specifies the period over which to calculate the ATR. This value is passed through the settings in `indicatorSettings.atr.period`.  
ATR shows the average magnitude of price fluctuations over a period, which can be useful for risk assessment and determining potential entry/exit points.

## 1.2 EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
**Purpose:** EMA is an indicator that gives more weight to recent prices compared to older ones, helping to identify the current trend.  
**How it's calculated:**  
Two EMA values are calculated in the code: EMA 14 (for a short period) and EMA 200 (for a long period).  
The `technicalIndicators.EMA.calculate` method is used, which takes a list of close prices (`closePrices`) and the period for calculation.  
This helps to determine the direction of the trend: if the short EMA (14) is above the long EMA (200), it may indicate an uptrend.

## 1.3 Bollinger Bands
**Purpose:** The Bollinger Bands indicator defines a price range around the moving average, taking into account the standard deviation.  
**How it's calculated:**  
The `technicalIndicators.BollingerBands.calculate` method is used to calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands. The `period` and `stdDev` parameters are taken from the settings (`indicatorSettings.bollingerBands`).  
Bollinger Bands indicate overbought and oversold zones:  
- A price at the upper band may signal a potential reversal (SELL).
- A price at the lower band may signal a potential reversal upward (BUY).

## 1.4 VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
**Purpose:** VWAP calculates the average price of an asset, weighted by volume, helping to understand the true price.  
**How it's calculated:**  
For each period, the volume-weighted average price is calculated using the closing price and trading volume. This calculation occurs in a loop.  
If the result is valid, it is added to the `vwap` array, and the last VWAP value is logged at the end.  
VWAP can serve as a benchmark for determining the average price of an asset for the day, and crossing the price with VWAP can be a signal for trading.

## 1.5 Heikin Ashi Candles
**Purpose:** Heikin Ashi candles use a modification of traditional candles to smooth fluctuations and make trends easier to spot.  
**How it's calculated:**  
For each candle, the open, close, high, and low are calculated based on the data from previous candles.  
These candles help to determine if there is a trend and make it easier to identify the direction of market movement.

## 1.6 Linear Regression
**Purpose:** Linear regression is used to identify the trend (slope of the line), which helps to determine the direction of market movement.  
**How it's calculated:**  
The `simple-statistics` library and the `ss.linearRegression` function are used for the calculation, which takes the close data and indices.  
After calculating the linear regression, we get two values: `slope` (the slope) and `intercept` (the intercept). If the slope is positive, it indicates an uptrend; if negative, a downtrend.

# Logic for generating **BUY** and **SELL** signals

The logic for generating **BUY** and **SELL** signals depends on the combination of various technical indicators and price data. Let's go through the signal generation process step by step:

## 1. **Trend check using EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**

EMA is an exponential moving average that gives more weight to more recent prices.

- **When to signal BUY:**
  - If `EMA14` (14-period exponential moving average) is greater than `EMA200` (200-period exponential moving average), indicating an uptrend.
  - The closing price (`latestClose`) must be greater than `EMA14`.
  - The price must be above `VWAP` (Volume Weighted Average Price), confirming that the price is in the trend and above the average market level.
  - The Heikin-Ashi candle must be bullish (i.e., `haClose > haOpen`), which also confirms the strength of the uptrend.

- **When to signal SELL:**
  - If `EMA14` is less than `EMA200`, indicating a downtrend.
  - The closing price must be less than `EMA14`.
  - The price must be below `VWAP`.
  - The Heikin-Ashi candle must be bearish (i.e., `haClose < haOpen`).

## 2. **Bollinger Bands breakout**

Bollinger Bands consist of three lines: a central line (usually SMA â€” Simple Moving Average) and two outer lines that deviate based on the standard deviation from the central line.

- **When to signal BUY:**
  - If the closing price (`latestClose`) breaks below the lower Bollinger Band. This may indicate that the asset is heavily oversold, and there is a potential for a rebound.

- **When to signal SELL:**
  - If the closing price breaks above the upper Bollinger Band. This may suggest that the asset is heavily overbought, and a downturn may be coming.

## 3. **Trend confirmation using linear regression**

Linear regression helps analyze the slope of the trend based on price. If the slope of the linear regression is positive, the trend is considered up, and if negative, the trend is down.

- **When to signal BUY (based on linear regression):**
  - If the slope of the linear regression is positive (indicating an uptrend), the BUY signal will be confirmed. If the current signal was SELL, it will be changed to BUY, as linear regression indicates an uptrend.

- **When to signal SELL (based on linear regression):**
  - If the slope of the linear regression is negative (indicating a downtrend), the SELL signal will be confirmed. If the current signal was BUY, it will be changed to SELL, as linear regression indicates a downtrend.

## 4. **Volatility filter using ATR (Average True Range)**

ATR is used to measure market volatility. It shows the average range of price movement over a specific period.

- **When to signal BUY:**
  - If the volatility measured by ATR exceeds a threshold value defined by the constant `VOLATILITY_THRESHOLD` (e.g., 0.01), the signal is considered valid. This helps avoid false signals in low-volatility conditions.

- **When to signal SELL:**
  - If the volatility does not exceed the set threshold, the volatility filter rejects the signal.

## 5. **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) filter**

VWAP is an indicator that helps assess the average price of an asset, considering trading volume. It is a type of average price that is more sensitive to changes in volume.

- **When to signal BUY:**
  - If the current closing price is above the VWAP, it may indicate that the price is in an uptrend and supported by volume.

- **When to signal SELL:**
  - If the closing price is below the VWAP, it may indicate that the trend is down, and selling may be justified.

## 6. **Confirmation using Heikin-Ashi candles**

Heikin-Ashi candles are a modification of regular Japanese candlesticks that smooth out price fluctuations and make trends more obvious.

- **When to signal BUY:**
  - If the latest Heikin-Ashi candle is bullish (i.e., `haClose > haOpen`), it confirms the strength of the uptrend.

- **When to signal SELL:**
  - If the latest Heikin-Ashi candle is bearish (i.e., `haClose < haOpen`), it confirms the strength of the downtrend.

---

## Final logic:

### 1. **For a BUY signal:**
   - **EMA14 > EMA200**, price is above EMA14, above VWAP, bullish Heikin-Ashi candle, and possibly a break below the lower Bollinger Band.
   - Linear regression indicates an uptrend (positive slope).
   - Volatility confirms the possibility of the trade.

### 2. **For a SELL signal:**
   - **EMA14 < EMA200**, price is below EMA14, below VWAP, bearish Heikin-Ashi candle, and possibly a break above the upper Bollinger Band.
   - Linear regression indicates a downtrend (negative slope).
   - Volatility confirms the possibility of the trade.

---

## Conclusion:

The **BUY** and **SELL** signals are generated based on the combination of several indicators that provide more reliable and justified trading decisions. Using indicators such as **EMA**, **Bollinger Bands**, **Heikin-Ashi**, **ATR**, **VWAP**, and **linear regression** allows for considering different aspects of the market situation and minimizing the risk of making incorrect decisions.


# Stop loss and Take profit logic

The `calculateStopLossTakeProfit` function is designed to calculate the stop-loss and take-profit levels based on the signal (buy or sell), entry price, and ATR (Average True Range) indicator.

## Parameters

- **`signal`** (string): The type of trade signal. Can be:
  - `'BUY'` â€” for calculating stop-loss and take-profit levels for a buy trade.
  - `'SELL'` â€” for calculating levels for a sell trade.

- **`entryPrice`** (number): The price at which the trade is entered.

- **`atr`** (number): The ATR indicator value, which is used to determine market volatility. This parameter affects the calculation of stop-loss and take-profit levels.

## Calculation Logic

- For **BUY** signal:
  - The stop-loss is calculated as `entryPrice - atr`.
  - The take-profit is calculated as `entryPrice + atr`.

- For **SELL** signal:
  - The stop-loss is calculated as `entryPrice + atr`.
  - The take-profit is calculated as `entryPrice - atr`.

## Result

The function returns an object with two properties:

- **`stopLoss`** (number): The stop-loss level.
- **`takeProfit`** (number): The take-profit level.
